                                        Image Captioning AI with BLIP and Gradio            
                
This project implements an AI model that generates descriptive captions for images using BLIP (Bootstrapping Language-Image Pre-training) from Hugging Face. 
BLIP is a state-of-the-art model pre-trained on large-scale image-text datasets, 
enabling it to produce accurate and contextually relevant captions. 
The project also features an easy-to-use web interface built with Gradio, allowing users to interact with the model directly from their browser.
